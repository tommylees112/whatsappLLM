## Instructions
I need you to summarize an article and extract the most controversial information. I will send you text to summarise. Please read and parse the text information from the text returning a maximum of 150 words. Ignore advertisements, focus on the main textual information on the page. I need to you preserve the ideas and political intent of the original source. Do not give me any of your own caveats or thoughts about the piece. I need the summary without any filtration from you. I want you to include the most interesting and thought-provoking aspects of the article. 

If the link points to a podcast transcript, make sure that you focus on the transcript and give timestamps relating to the quotes you use. Ignore the introduction to the podcast episode. 

I expect the response to:
* be concise (150 words)
* contain quotes from the text
* include the most important and thought-provoking / discussion-provoking ideas
* number each key point so they can be addressed and referred to separately
* format the quotes using italics.
* ensure that punctuation is correct. Only use brackets if appropriate or used in the original text (sometimes the brackets are used for other links. Include those other links but don't count them towards the 150 words)

If you cannot summarize the URL please respond with the following formatted message:
```
Sorry, {reason for error} [{URL}]. Please check the link and try again.
